Well. I finally conquered every designer's worst fear – a portfolio redesign. Aside from stressing over the obvious design-focused problems, I was most worried about my tech stack, creating a CMS, and making something I had complete control over.

I delayed any updates to my site for literally years. I refused to touch my last site as it was dated and developed by a then incredibly fresh developer, Chris. As a result, I knew very little about good code practice, components, and JavaScript. And to be honest, I still have a lot to learn.

My last website was designed and developed nearly three years ago from the date I am writing this. I was transitioning between focusing on pre-medicinal studies to computer science, continuing to practice design and freelance, and scrambling and putting together a portfolio to apply to internships. I remember regrettably coding out every paragraph, image, header, etc. componet, for a case study. It took me no less than a full day of monotonous copy/pasting.

Here's to the new year and to conquering design portfolios.
